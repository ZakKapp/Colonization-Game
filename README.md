# Colonization-Game
The goal of this project is to create a game that is completely handled by the computer and uses multiple threads to handle game logic.
On game initialization, the user inputs the size of the board and the number of players on each team. Each individual team member is handled by its own thread.
This was a lab assignment for an Operating Systems class at Central Washington University. This was coded and executed on a linux environment.
